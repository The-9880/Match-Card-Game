# Match-Card-Game
A little project done for a CS course a while back. Uploaded for historical purposes, the game ends when a player empties their hand of
cards by making matches. The game is automated, so you can't actually play - playing the game constitutes either putting down a card or
picking one up, so it's not particularly engaging anyways.
